It&apos;s about twelve light-years away, I think.&quot; &quot;Eleven point nine,&quot; said Xi. &quot;Very good. Most would not know that.&quot; &quot;I teach junior high school science,&quot; I said. &quot;These things come up.&quot; Xi and the Russian shot each other surprised looks. Then they both looked at Stratt. Stratt stared them down. &quot;There&apos;s more to him than that.&quot; Xi regained her composure (not that she&apos;d lost much of it anyway). &quot;Ahem. In any event, Tau Ceti is very much inside the cluster of infected stars. In fact, it is near the center.&quot [,..] “Okay,” I said. “I’m sensing there’s something special about it?” “It is not infected,” Xi said. “Every star around it is. There are two very infected stars well within eight light-years of Tau Ceti, yet it remains unaffected.” “Why?” Stratt shuffled through her papers. “That’s what we want to find out. So we’re going to make a ship and send it there.”</i>">
